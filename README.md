Active learning: Embedding your own audio and video

For this active learning, we'd (ideally) like you to go out into the world and record some of your own video and audio â€” most phones these days allow you to record audio and video very easily and, provided you can transfer it on to your computer, you can use it. You may have to do some conversion to end up with a WebM and MP4 in the case of video, and an MP3 and Ogg in the case of audio, but there are enough programs out there to allow you to do this without too much trouble, such as Miro Video Converter and Audacity. We'd like you to have a go!

If you are unable to source any video or audio, then you can feel free to use our sample audio and video files to carry out this exercise. You can also use our sample code for reference.

We would like you to:

1. Save your audio and video files in a new directory on your computer.

2. Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index.html.

3. Add &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls.

4. Give both of them &lt;source&gt; elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it. These should include type attributes.

5. Give the &lt;video&gt; element a poster that will be displayed before the video starts to be played. Have fun creating your own poster graphic.

For an added bonus, you could try researching text tracks, and work out how to add some captions to your video.
